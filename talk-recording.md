# Recording talks with picture in picture

I wrote some notes when I recorded my talk for Tech Nottingham.

I used:

- A Macbook
- Two screens (optional)
  - 1 for slides and PIP
  - 2 for speaker notes (or anything else you don't want visible in the video)
- Google Chrome / Slides
  - These instructions probably work for Keynote or Powerpoint too - just tweak the Chrome / Slides bits.
- QuickTime Player
- Zoom

## Recording steps

The order of these steps is a bit fiddly, but I found I had problems with recording when I didn't follow them exactly.

- Run Chrome in app mode on desktop 1 (my larger external monitor), opening your slides:

```shell
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --app=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/replace-this-with-your-slides-url
```

- Present in speaker mode.
  - Don't make it fullscreen yet, or screen recording won't work!

- Drag speaker notes to desktop 2 (my smaller laptop screen).

- Start a private Zoom meeting.

- Screenshare anything that isn't on desktop 1.
  - It doesn't matter what, as we're only using Zoom for the PIP window - I used my speaker notes.

- Drag the PIP window onto desktop 1.
  - I positioned it to the top right of my slides, as I don't normally have content there.

- Open QuickTime player.

- Start a new screen recording.
  - Make sure you have the correct mic or headset audio enabled in the options.

- Click on desktop 1 to begin recording.

- Now you can make the slides full screen.
  - Note that this means the start of your recording will be a second or two of clicking to make things full screen.
  - I didn't bother editing my recording to remove it, but I guess you could.

- Stop recording once you're done. :tada:

## Other general reminders

- Turn off notifications!
  - Top right-hand side button to get Notification Center.
  - Scroll up.
  - Set do not disturb mode.

- For Google Slides, preload images by scrolling to the end and back.
  - If you use lots of full screen background images like I do, Slides doesn't preload them.
  - When you click to the next slide, it loads them choppily, which looks rubbish especially on screenshare / recording.
  - Scrolling through to the end of your presentation then going back to the beginning before you start recording fixes this.

- Phone on silent.
  - Totally didn't happen to me mid-recording.

- Close all non-essential apps.
  - Still managed to have Zoom choose to update itself halfway though my recording anyway.

- The Google Drive app was the easiest way I found to upload and share the recording with the organisers.

Good luck! :slightly_smiling_face:
